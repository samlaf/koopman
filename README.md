# Koopman examples
Most of the notebooks are about controlling a toy dynamical systems using Koopman techniques.

So far we have
1. Mass-Spring-Damper system with PID control
2. Van der Pol Oscillator with PID control and Koopman-LQR control
3. EDMD on linear system

There's also an analysis of Koopman sysid in bruntons_example.ipynb, which accompanies a [blog post](https://samlaf.github.io/koopman-bruntons-toy-example.html).
